Documenting Steps to Create HTML in Github with Github.dev functioning.
On new PC, download and install Github Desktop version.
Succesfully installed Github Desktop version and linked to my existing Github profile.
The use of Github.dev functioned properly on new PC. 
It is a shame that Github.dev issue on my orginal PC never got resolved. I feel like I am starting all the work over once again from back at the beginning of the semester because we still need to use Github.dev.
Making use of the Jekyll GitHub forum, I am following the instructions to get Jekyll installed on my new PC.
I am not downloading and installing Ruby through the RubyInstallers for Windows.
Ruby has been sucessfully installed.
Following the directions on the Jekyll installation webpage, I used the Command Window to verify the Ruby version, the GCC, and Make vesrions installed.
