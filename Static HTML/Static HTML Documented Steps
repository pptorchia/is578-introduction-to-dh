Documenting Steps to Create HTML in Github with Github.dev functioning.
On new PC, download and install Github Desktop version.
Succesfully installed Github Desktop version and linked to my existing Github profile.
The use of Github.dev functioned properly on new PC. 
It is a shame that Github.dev issue on my orginal PC never got resolved. I feel like I am starting all the work over once again from back at the beginning of the semester because we still need to use Github.dev.
Making use of the Jekyll GitHub forum, I am following the instructions to get Jekyll installed on my new PC.
I am not downloading and installing Ruby through the RubyInstallers for Windows.
Ruby has been sucessfully installed.
Following the directions on the Jekyll installation webpage, I used the Command Window to verify the Ruby version, the GCC, and Make vesrions installed.
Jekyll Installation: Using Command Window
Working on bundler and gems
At this point I am stuck for some time on not being able to bundler or gems commands to work.
I have tried to change directories, but the command can not locate Gemfile or .bundle directory.
C:\Users\pptor>jekyll new myblog
Running bundle install in C:/Users/pptor/myblog...
New jekyll site installed in C:/Users/pptor/myblog.
Build the site and make it available on a local server.
bundle exec jekyll serve
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for 'C:/Users/pptor/myblog'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
  To my understanding this has created a local server and this local server is running from my PC.
  Browse to http://localhost:4000
  Looks like I have a static HTML page created Welcome to Jekyll. Looks like it is hosted on my PC.
