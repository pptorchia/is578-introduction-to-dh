# is578-introduction-to-dh
This is my repository for IS 578: Introduction to Digital Humanities.

My original README file was created in my repository at github.com. When switching to github.dev, my repository, and the files would not open. I continue getting an error when opening the repository or the original README file.
After making multiple attempts to switch from github.com to github.dev, I continue getting error messages when opening the original README file.
So, I am creating a new README file to move forward with the exercise/assignment.

I created a new README file on github.dev. I was able to write text into a new file, but the new file would not save in github.dev. 

As it turns out, nothing I tried to do in github.dev worked. Once again, the fact that the tools are working according to the instructions in the assignment has left me very frustrated.

So, I am using github.com to complete the Tools DH assignment. This is now my UPDATED README file.
