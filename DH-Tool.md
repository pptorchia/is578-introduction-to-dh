I consider this to be a "DH tool" because, as a web content management system, this digital tool can assist humanists in organizing work around publishing, media collections, and hosting discussion forums. To support WordPress as a DH tool, I have discovered and noted that academic libraries include WordPress within their Digital Humanities tools and resources LibGuides. Also, the co-authors of the short paper, "WordPress as a framework for automated data capture, filtering, and structuring processes. The new order of the authors
", Cruces-Rodriguez, Rodriguez Ortega, and Polo used WordPress as a framework for other digital work such as web interaction, data extraction, and delivering structured data to a variety of data-analysis-based systems. This tells me that while WordPress may not be doing the data processing, it can provide a workflow framework to organize and guide other digital tasks.
